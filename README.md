## Game Modes ‚öîÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ Casual: Allows the user to practice his knowledge playing against himself, simulating a game of chess.

‚Ä¢ Bot: Allows the user to play a game of chess against a custom AI opponent designed in a tricky manner.

## Complete implementation of Classic Chess Rules

Regarding both game modes, all classic chess rules are implemented, ensuring an authentic gameplay experience.
From the movement of individual pieces, to special moves such as castling and en passant, every aspect of traditional chess
is faithfully reproduced.

## Features üé®

‚Ä¢ Piece selection: Selecting a piece shows the player all the possible moves available in that position.

‚Ä¢ With no room for explotation, players can trust that all possible moves are legitimate, enhancing the integrity of each match.

‚Ä¢ Draw by repetition: When the same position occurs three times during a game, it concludes into a DRAW.

‚Ä¢ User-friendly: Players have the option to either drag and drop pieces to make their move or to select a piece and then click on the destination square.

## About AI ü§ñ

The AI featured in the Bot game mode is powered by the Minimax algorithm, allowing it to plan three moves ahead.

The selection of its moves is determined by a custom board evaluation method crafted using various criteria, including piece value, piece development, and piece centralization.

It is also programmed to recognize and consider strategic possibilities such as checking, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion during gameplay.

During the early game, the AI prioritizes controlling the center of the board and adopts a defensive stance to safeguard its position. In the endgame, its focus shifts towards promoting pawns and capturing enemy pieces to gain a strategic advantage.

In recent tests, the AI has demonstrated its proficiency by defeating the 550 Elo bot on Chess.com. 
I acknowledge that Elo ratings have their limitations, but given the computational power at my disposal, it's a notable achievement for my AI to have defeated the 550 Elo bot on Chess.com.

In some situations he might take longer to think about his next move, but be patient, he is trying his best ( I hope so ü•∫).

It is far from perfect, but its gameplay carries a distinct personality.
